                  Membership, you will become liable for automatic renewal

                  We operate an automatic renewal billing policy on our Premium

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This means that once your initial membership period has
                  expired, for your convenience, your membership will
                  automatically be renewed at the same rate that you signed up
                  for using the original payment method. For example, if you pay
                  by credit card, we will continue to debit this same credit
                  card as each subscription period expires. We will only debit
                  these repeat payments when your current payment period expires
                  and not before. From time to time we enroll our loyal
                  customers in a loyalty program where the randomly chosen
                  customers will be granted a discounted membership price on the
                  next payment only.

                  and accurate (such as a change in billing address, card
                  number, or expiration date), and you will promptly notify us
                  if your payment method is cancelled (including if you lose
                  your card or it is stolen), or if you become aware of a
                  potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized
                  disclosure or use of your name or password). If you fail to
                  provide us any of this information, we will hold you

                  <br />
                  The Premium Membership subscription will be automatically
                  extended for successive renewal period of the same duration as
                  the subscription term originally selected, at the then current

                  Automatic Renewal Billing process explained in these Terms and
                  Conditions.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Please note that you must terminate your subscription at least
                  7 days prior to the end of the subscription period for which
                  you have paid to avoid being charged for the next subscription
                  period. To change or terminate your subscription at any time,
